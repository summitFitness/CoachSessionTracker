Last updated: February 15, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Summit Day Fitness** ("we", "us", "our") handles information when you use the Coach Tracker iOS app (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect and process the following categories of information:

- Account and profile data you provide (for example, coach/admin profile details).
- Operational data you enter in the App (for example, schedules, attendance, session records, notes, and related business records).
- Support communications (for example, messages you send to support).
- Technical data needed to operate the App (for example, crash/error diagnostics if enabled by your deployment).

## 2. Permissions

The App may request device permissions:

- **Calendar**: used so users can add or view relevant session/schedule events.
- **Reminders**: used so users can create reminders for upcoming sessions.

You can deny these permissions or revoke them later in iOS Settings.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Provide and operate App features.
- Store, sync, and retrieve business records.
- Improve performance, reliability, and security.
- Respond to support and troubleshooting requests.
- Meet legal or regulatory requirements.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell personal information.

We may share data only as needed with:

- Service providers that help us host, store, or process data (for example, backend infrastructure providers).
- Legal or regulatory authorities when required by law.
- A successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or reorganization.

If your organization deploys Coach Tracker, your organization may control and access the data entered by its users.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain data for as long as needed to provide the App and satisfy legal, accounting, or compliance obligations, unless a shorter period is required by law or requested by your organization.

## 6. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. International Transfers

If data is processed in countries other than your own, we take reasonable steps to protect it under applicable law.

## 8. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights to:
